Over the years, i met several people that left quite an impact on me and, in many cases, helped me along the way.

I tried to summarize one learning from each.

I split it into stages of my life. Growing up in Vienna; moving to London and Berlin, running my own companies, moving to SF to work on multiple companies there… etc.  

A lot of the people i mention here overlapped in different phases of my life. 
E.g. the people i hired for our startup later also joined companies i worked at in San Francisco – i tried to put them into the buckets where i met them the first time or where we worked together the most.

Besides this attempt at structure, this list is in no particular order and misses about 1000000 people, most likely including you.
