summary: 'Why abstract ideas matter the most'
---

[WIP] below follows a few thoughts and guidelines of what will eventually be written.

### Definitions
- Concrete: solving education
- Abstract: creating a reputation infrastructure

### Provocation
Most people think concrete is more important than abstract, because concrete is palpable and actually makes a difference in people's lives.

### Unique insight
As abstract is hard to understand and to value, it is rarely prioritized. If we really want to solve problems, we need to tackle abstract problems.

### Motivation
Whenever I see someone working in education or something like that, I get the feeling that it is extremely noble, but unfortunately very hard to really execute and make a difference.

### Examples
Blockchains are abstract technologies. Bitcoin seems silly until someone dies and you see that the underlying law is the law of Bitcoin.
